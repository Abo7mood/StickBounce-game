## Story of this game 📚
--------------------------

StickBounce was created as a **solo project**, born from my interest in **physics-based game mechanics**. I wanted to design a game where movement and precision are key, requiring players to master **rotation and boosting mechanics** to navigate different levels. 

The game’s development involved fine-tuning the **physics interactions**, ensuring the experience was both **challenging and rewarding**. Each level was crafted to push the player's skills, demanding **precise timing and calculated moves**.

Building **StickBounce** was a valuable journey, reinforcing my expertise in **physics simulations and game balancing**, making it one of my most engaging solo projects. 🚀
